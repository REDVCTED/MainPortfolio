          <p>Hi I'm Selwyn Davenport a former electrician and C programmer. I graduated in Electrical engineering at Humber college in 2018 and was given a Degree. At the time I worked for a small electrical company for around a year until they went out of buisness and I learned that I had an aspiration to learn coding. Afterwards I spent about 1.5 years just learning to code in C and C# before deciding to enroll in a conding bootcamp offered by the University of Toronto. At the time of writing, I currently work as a cook at Moxie's and I intend to do so until I have finished my studies and feel confident in my ability to code. Afterwords I will attempt to find work in a relevant indestry to once again get my foot in the door.</p>
          <p>On a less professional note,  I consider myself to be a 3D printer hobiest as I have built 2 and a PC enthusiast because I have also built 3 of them and asways keep my PC Hardware to the most highest teir possible. For reference my current PC specs are as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Core i9-9900k</li>
            <li>32 gb of Ram</li>
            <li>2x 2070 Supers in SLI (using NvLink) </li>
            <li>A 1000w Power Supply</li>
            <li>And all on a Custom Water loop</li>
          </ul>  
          <p>As you can see I kind of like computers. But thats all form me, if you have any questions you can find a contact button at the top of the screen. Feel free to also check out the other work i have done in the Portfolio Section, I'll try to keep that updated for you.</p>
          <p>Until then Thankyou for Visiting</p>
